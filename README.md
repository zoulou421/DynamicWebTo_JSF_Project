# Dynamic Web Project converted to JSF Project
## It is possible to transform your dynamic web app into a javaServer Faces Project

## Create an existing, non-JSF project in Eclipse Oxygen.  Add the JSF project facet to it, so that it can be used with JSF.  Add Mojarra libraries manually to the project facet.  Deploy the project in Eclipse Oxygen.  Fix "zip file is empty".
